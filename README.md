# Chapeaux Fous

Chapeaux Fous is a small, inspectable model-and-tools application. The internal
repository and compatibility identifiers still use `agent-slayer`. It is not an
agent framework and has no plugin host. The request compiler, tool registry,
MariaDB ledger, and web client are provider-neutral. The installed transport is the
directly billed OpenAI Responses API because it supports first-class image
input, response chains, structured outputs, and application-defined functions.

The complete request path is:

```text
web or voice input
  -> orientation call with the exact request, bounded source context, and compact capability/tool catalog
  -> deterministic TurnBrief validation, with one visible correction pass for invalid weekday/date claims
  -> strict, source-referenced TurnBrief plus rolling conversation state
  -> execution call with the accepted TurnBrief and exact initial tool schemas
  -> optional exact-tool expansion inside accepted capability families, preserving receipts
  -> local or MCP tool execution, with results returned to that same model exchange
  -> conditional receipt-based completion audit
  -> optional receipt-aware repair within the remaining turn-wide budget
  -> final response
```

Every boundary is recorded in `activity_events` and shown in the web trace:
user request, orientation, rolling state, execution, conditional audit and
repair, context, tools, exact model requests and responses, tool calls and
results, per-step usage, and the final answer.

Validated TurnBriefs proceed directly to execution by default; their full
contents remain visible in the trace. For closer supervision of one request,
open **Run limits** before submitting it and enable the retained TurnBrief
Continue/Cancel prompt.

Orientation receives the current local weekday, date, time zone, and an
eight-day local calendar table. Named-weekday action targets are recorded in
the TurnBrief and checked with deterministic Gregorian calendar code before
execution. Native to-do and calendar scheduling also validate proposed UTC timestamps
against those accepted local-date targets before beginning their transactions.

## Hats and the user manual

Users may make one or more roles explicit with the convention:

```text
Chapeaux Fous, as my [hat], [request].
```

Hats are optional and are never inferred. Requests without a spoken hat use the
ordinary capability selector exactly as before. More than one hat can be spoken
in one request, and ordinary tool selection may add other supporting tool
families without labeling them as hats. `config/hats.json` is the versioned
catalog of public names, aliases, destination capabilities, descriptions,
examples, and SVG artwork. The request compiler and the web client's **Hats**
manual screen both use that catalog; live availability and backing tool names
come from the actual callable tool registry. The web client displays hat artwork
only for hats the user explicitly spoke; it does not place the hats on a
character. With several spoken hats, it shows the first at full size and the
others as companion badges.

The same catalog also grounds chat answers about how to interact with Chapeaux
Fous and how the hats system works. The focused read-only self-knowledge tool
returns the manual rules, invocation form, examples, and registry-derived live
availability as facts; the model answers the user's particular question in
natural language rather than returning a canned help response.

## First local run

Requirements: Node.js 22.5 or newer, an OpenAI API project/key with API billing,
and an initialized MariaDB database matching `db/mariadb/0001-baseline.sql`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set OPENAI_API_KEY, SLAYER_ACCESS_TOKEN, and the MARIADB_* values.
npm install
npm run db:verify
npm test
npm start
```

The test suite creates and drops isolated databases. The configured application
account may do that locally, or `MARIADB_TEST_*` can name a separate
test administrator as shown in `.env.example`.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787/app`. The root URL serves the public landing page.
The app asks for `SLAYER_ACCESS_TOKEN` and
stores it only in that browser. The same client includes the Agent request
feed, the calendar, the grouped to-do list, a searchable contacts address book,
a grouped personal journal with native entry creation, and a dedicated **Briefings**
screen for maintaining reusable, agent-led conversations and their numbered
exchanges. Starting or resuming a briefing from that screen queues a normal
Agent request, so the conversation still passes through orientation, TurnBrief
selection, exact tool schemas, and the literal trace. The screen itself is a
domain-management page, not an additional model-callable tool. Contacts support
people, organizations, and services with tags, birthday, notes, and stacked
contact methods. Possible duplicates are reviewed and merged explicitly; source records
remain as inactive history so existing references are preserved. Stored birthdays
continue to appear on the calendar. Agent requests may include one JPEG, PNG,
WebP, GIF, CSV, TSV, JSON, JSON Lines, vCard/VCF, or plain-text attachment. Text is decoded as UTF-8,
UTF-16, or Windows-1252. Image originals remain in the existing media store and
are loaded only while the queued request is processed. OpenAI receives images at
the configured detail; `original` is the default so small receipt text remains
visible. Small text files appear in full in visible model context;
large files contribute a bounded preview while native file tools can process the verified
full attachment. A task's Schedule
button opens the calendar in day-pick mode; selecting a day writes the task's
scheduled date as an all-day task. Timed tasks remain available through the
to-do editor and agent tools.

Each finished Agent exchange also exposes a chat-style **↩ Reply** action. It
places an `In reference to:` block with the full source request ID in the
composer. On submission, the server validates that ID and records it as bounded
request metadata; orientation and execution then receive the source-referenced
request and response even when that exchange is outside ordinary recent history.

`.env` intentionally lives beside `.env.example` in the repository root. It is
ignored by Git and loaded by the process before configuration is evaluated.

## OpenAI Responses connection

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and the desired `SLAYER_MODEL` in `.env`, then restart the
process. The key remains server-side,
is absent from health and traces, and is redacted from provider errors. Every
Responses API call contains the exact currently callable function schemas.
Function results return through `function_call_output` in the same persisted
response chain before that execution or repair call can finish. Orientation and
completion audit calls have no callable functions and use strict structured
outputs instead.

`SLAYER_OPENAI_IMAGE_DETAIL=original` favors receipt legibility. Change it to
`high` or `low` when input-token efficiency matters more than tiny visual
details. `SLAYER_MAX_REQUEST_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` is a generous operational memory
ceiling, not a usage allowance, and can be raised. The dedicated **AI Usage**
screen totals recorded tokens and estimates USD cost. Its per-million-token
prices are set only on that screen and saved in browser storage. These same
rates calculate both usage totals and individual response estimates, including
historical requests. There are no server, environment, or built-in price
defaults. Without saved prices, dollar estimates remain unavailable. The server
records token usage without assigning prices or calculating new costs. These
estimates apply the entered rates to all models in the recorded history; they
are not a reconciliation with the provider invoice.

## Conversation state

Each workflow phase is an explicit model interaction. Agent Slayer supplies
bounded application-owned context and the accepted TurnBrief instead of relying
on an opaque provider thread to remember what a short follow-up meant. If an
execution call requests an additional cataloged tool inside an accepted
capability family, its continuation receives that exact schema, the original
request, and bounded receipts for tools already used in that request. Legacy
direct execution may also request one additional cataloged capability.

Agent Slayer stores a compact, source-referenced rolling conversation state
after orientation. This state is an index, not authority: each new orienter also
receives exact recent ledger entries and may retain or change state only when
those event numbers support it. A bounded conversation checkpoint remains a
fallback when no structured state exists. Starting a new conversation creates a
ledger boundary for both recent context and rolling state without deleting
application history.

Active `time_zone`, `time_format`, `date_format`, `measurement_system`, and
`temperature_unit` profile facts are presentation preferences and accompany
every model interaction. Human-facing concrete dates use `Mon, 31 Aug 2026`;
the final response boundary deterministically normalizes unambiguous prose
dates while preserving ISO values in code, JSON, timestamps, URLs, filenames,
tool data, receipts, and schemas. Measurement and temperature preferences guide
new prose and display conversions without rewriting authoritative stored or
quoted values.

`config/profile-fact-questions.json` also defines the standard core-profile
onboarding brief. It collects a preferred name, default geographic location,
time zone, time format, measurement system, and temperature unit when the user
explicitly starts profile setup. Outside onboarding, the same catalog selects
only profile types relevant to the current request. Geographic requests such as
rain forecasts select `default_location`; a saved time zone never substitutes
for a city or region.

Deferred operations returned by an MCP remain owned by that MCP. Agent Slayer
does not copy their plans, payloads, readiness state, or lifecycle into a native
table or artifact event. It derives a small opaque action reference from the
existing immutable tool receipt so a later approval can select the exact
provider identifier; the MCP still validates and executes the operation. A
provider result that requests confirmation without a complete, schema-valid
same-provider action handoff is recorded as a terminal contract failure instead
of being presented for approval. Its exact result remains recoverable from the
receipt. Each orientation receives a bounded index of recent receipts without
their payloads, allowing execution to page a relevant exact receipt and recover
provider-owned workflow state rather than asking the user for an opaque ID.
Recovered evidence still cannot substitute for explicit mutation approval.

The default model is `gpt-5.6-terra`; change `SLAYER_MODEL` explicitly if
desired.

## Model transport boundary

`SlayerRuntime` depends only on the transport contract in
`src/model-transport.mjs`: identity, lifecycle, health, exact request
description, and `runTurn`. Tool definitions and tool results stay in Slayer's
provider-neutral format. A transport adapter performs protocol translation and
returns a normalized final response, usage report, and provider trace.

The installed adapter is `openai-responses`. The provider-neutral contract is
retained deliberately: another provider should require a protocol adapter while
modality-independent context, database, tools, queueing, and ledger behavior
remain owned by Slayer. This is an explicit application boundary, not a plugin
system.

## Request and context compilation

Agent Slayer owns request and context compilation in application code.
Orientation receives the exact request, verified attachment context, exact
recent ledger entries, prior rolling state, explicit hats, and an organized
catalog of every connected capability family with compact provider-published
tool summaries but no callable schemas. It emits a strict `TurnBrief`
that classifies continuations, authorizations, corrections, additions, and new
objectives; identifies authorized and prohibited actions; selects required
capabilities and the smallest likely initial tool set; and defines concrete
completion criteria. Source-grounded fields carry ledger event numbers. This
lets “go ahead and do that” preserve a specific prior offer without hoping the
executor infers the same continuity.

Execution is compiled from the accepted TurnBrief. It receives the exact schemas
for the selected initial tools plus versioned guidance from
`config/instructions/`; `config/system-prompt.md` contains only universal
behavior. A bounded `request_tools` call can add exact schemas for omitted tools
inside the accepted capability families while preserving same-request receipts.
A newly registered local tool that has not yet been assigned to a capability
still forces the conservative full fallback so additions cannot silently
disappear.

The selected tool list is enforcement, not a hint: a model call outside the
current interaction's callable set is rejected before the application function
can run. Orientation and audit have no callable domain tools. Cataloged
capabilities become callable only after their exact schemas are present in an
execution interaction or continuation.
The trace records the selection reasons, selected versus available counts, the
exact provider-facing schemas and serialized bytes actually sent, instruction
character counts, and whether schemas were sent with a new thread or retained
on a resumed thread.

## Model usage

OpenAI calls record literal input, cached-input, output, reasoning, and total
tokens plus an estimated cost using configurable prices. The AI Usage screen
shows month and recorded totals and a per-call history. Estimates are editable
because provider prices can change; historical token counts remain the durable
authority. Each request card and trace also break usage down by orientation,
execution, audit, and repair, including reasoning effort, tokens, elapsed time,
and recorded estimated cost. Orientation defaults to `medium` reasoning,
execution uses the main configured effort, audit defaults to `low`, and repair
uses its own strong effort. These are configurable with
`SLAYER_ORIENTATION_REASONING_EFFORT`, `SLAYER_REASONING_EFFORT`,
`SLAYER_AUDIT_REASONING_EFFORT`, and `SLAYER_REPAIR_REASONING_EFFORT`.

## Tools

Local tools are ordinary JavaScript functions:

Native database-backed tool results preserve stored column names. Their owning
tool's input/output schemas and execution description explain those fields.
MariaDB table and column comments document storage meaning; longer notes and
view descriptions live beside their definitions in the baseline SQL. Explicit
`database_schema` calls can read live comments. Ordinary results carry no extra
schema-description payload and no generated schema file is required.

Native discovery also has one in-process search coordinator. Calendar,
contacts, and conversation history keep their own matching and completeness
rules behind provider adapters, while the coordinator handles bounded
cross-domain fan-out, compact normalized hits, source-diverse interleaving, and
literal partial-failure reporting. This is separate from the pre-model
capability selector, which controls which exact tool schemas are callable.

- `web_page_read` fetches one explicit HTTP(S) URL and returns bounded extracted
  text, metadata, and links so the model can follow pagination or directly
  related pages. It is not a search tool. Each redirect is checked, private and
  local network targets are rejected, DNS is pinned for the request, and binary
  responses are not returned to the model.
- `todo_group_list`, `todo_group_create`, `todo_group_rename`,
  `todo_group_sequence_set`, `todo_group_archive`, `todo_list`, `todo_add`,
  `todo_interaction_guide_set`, `todo_position_set`, and `todo_update` provide the native personal to-do path
  without requiring the model to invent SQL. The agent inspects existing groups before
  assigning an otherwise ungrouped task; Inbox is the catchall when no group is
  a clear match. Group archival fails while active tasks remain and preserves
  the group on terminal task history. To-dos are deliberately non-temporal:
  schedules, deadlines, durations, all-day state, and recurrence belong to the
  calendar. New and existing tasks can be
  placed at an exact 1-based manual sort position, including position 1.
  `todo_update` applies one through 500 independently identified changes in one
  atomic call, using the same array schema for a singular update.
- `calendar_event_search`, `calendar_event_list`, `calendar_event_add`,
  `calendar_event_update`, `calendar_event_recurrence_set`,
  `calendar_event_todo_links_set`, `calendar_todo_links_place`, `calendar_routine_list`,
  `calendar_routine_add`, `calendar_routine_update`, and
  `calendar_routine_generate` provide the native model-facing calendar
  path. Event records retain exact `calendar_events` column names and tool-owned
  field descriptions, while range reads identify expanded recurrence and birthday
  instances as computed occurrences. All-day scheduling is explicit and
  recurrence is supplied as structured concepts rather than raw RRULE. The
  product-facing event states are Active and Archived; iCalendar status values
  remain an internal storage and interoperability detail. Search matches every
  supplied term across stored event titles, descriptions, and locations, with
  archived events available only when requested. Calendar routines generate
  concrete events for bounded date ranges and never generate to-dos. Events and
  to-dos have a many-to-many relationship with explicit work, deadline, or
  context semantics. A saved event can
  create one standardized invitation email draft addressed to active contacts
  through the configured JMAP mail account. This action creates a draft only:
  it never sends the message, writes to a remote calendar, or changes the local
  calendar's authority. Every displayed agenda event also has a phone-friendly
  copy action for sharing its saved details through another app.
- `journal_add`, `journal_import`, `journal_list`, `journal_update`, `tracker_list`, and `tracker_update`
  provide the native grouped personal-journal path. Each entry keeps complete
  natural-language content with an optional numeric projection for calculation
  and trends. Each tracker owns the one canonical unit shared by its numeric
  series; entries do not duplicate it. Exact-ID corrections update an original entry without
  creating a duplicate. Bounded imports use generic source and external IDs for
  safe replay without source-specific application code.
- `contact_file_import` parses a complete attached CSV or vCard/VCF directly,
  importing up to 10,000 contacts in one transaction without asking the model
  to reproduce every row. The model maps CSV headers from a bounded preview;
  the application processes the full verified file. `contact_import` remains
  available for up to 200 contacts supplied as structured data without a file.
  Stable source IDs make replays idempotent, and each contact can retain multiple
  methods, notes, and reusable overlapping tags. `contact_duplicate_list` gives
  the model the same candidate groups shown by the Contacts review UI. Exact
  normalized names are candidates directly; different full names require both
  a shared normalized name word and an exact email or phone. Partial-name
  candidates remain review-only. The Contacts view uses row checkboxes in place
  of initials avatars for atomic bulk tag addition and permanent deletion.
  Existing contacts' postal addresses can be added or replaced in place with
  `contact_address_update`; it version-checks the selected contacts, preserves
  unrelated details, rejects ambiguous address additions, and never creates a
  contact record. Tags
  can be renamed across all assigned contacts from either the UI or the
  `contact_tag_rename` agent tool; an existing destination tag is merged safely.
  `contact_lookup_batch` resolves up to 500 names at once and
  `contact_tag_add_batch` applies one tag to as many as 10,000 contacts in one
  atomic, replay-safe call rather than consuming one model tool call per row.
  `contact_merge` atomically applies one through 100 AI-reviewed merge groups
  through the same bounded array, combining contact details while retaining
  source records as inactive history. Compact duplicate pages let one agent request review and
  resolve hundreds of groups without spending one tool call per merge.
  `contact_dedupe_clear` handles up to 500 conservative source-aware groups per
  call when names match and exact email or phone evidence connects records from
  distinct imports; ambiguous groups remain queued for AI judgment.
- `profile_fact_list`, `profile_fact_set`, and `profile_fact_delete` manage the
  durable user facts selected as relevant to each first model request.
- `interaction_guide_list`, `interaction_guide_get`,
  `interaction_guide_create`, `interaction_guide_update`,
  `interaction_guide_step_add`, `interaction_guide_step_update`,
  `interaction_guide_step_move`,
  `interaction_guide_start`, `interaction_guide_step_answer`,
  `interaction_guide_run_cancel`, and
  `interaction_guide_archive` manage durable user-owned briefings for
  potentially multi-request conversations. A briefing is a named, versioned
  container for numbered exchanges. Each exchange has a fixed opening, agent
  instructions, JSON answers, explicit pending/active/completed progress, and a
  constrained completion mode. Current progress supports exact interruption
  and resumption; immutable run and answer history remains in the ledger. A
  recurring to-do may link to a briefing while continuing to own its schedule and
  recurrence. An exchange can move to one other briefing without shared
  ownership; it is appended there while prior run history remains in the ledger.
  Under Briefings on the Check-in page, editable exchanges can be dragged into a new order (or
  moved with the handle's Up and Down arrow keys); saving renumbers the complete
  exchange sequence atomically and records the change in the ledger.
  Each successfully completed request exposes **Make this exchange repeatable**, which
  queues a normal traced agent turn to generalize that exact exchange into a
  new briefing and its minimal numbered exchanges; the resulting receipt links back to
  the source request and opens the created briefing from the original request card.
- `database_schema` and paginated `database_read` are a small read-only core
  capability available on every model request, including access to the native
  activity ledger. `database_write` is a separately routed capability, so broad
  database mutation authority is not sent merely to permit inspection. Ledger
  and schema tables remain protected from model writes. Explicit schema inspection
  returns live MariaDB table and column comments.
- `tool_receipt_list` and `tool_receipt_read` expose bounded, paginated access
  to exact historical call/result receipts. Tool results larger than
  `SLAYER_MAX_INLINE_TOOL_RESULT_CHARACTERS` remain whole in MariaDB while the
  live model exchange receives a first chunk and receipt cursor. The model can
  retrieve additional chunks without repeating the original read or write.
- `history_recent`, `history_search`, and `history_range` read the
  application-owned exchange history. Date-range retrieval returns paired
  requests and responses, supports relative local periods through explicit UTC
  boundaries, and can apply a topical term filter across both sides of each
  exchange in the same lookup.
- `global_search` performs read-only discovery across selected calendar,
  contacts, and history providers. It returns compact references and reports
  each provider's actual matching mode, capabilities, completeness, warnings,
  and errors. History and file discovery use MariaDB FULLTEXT indexes with
  bounded contextual snippets and deterministic fallbacks for short tokens,
  stopwords, accents, phrases, and proximity. Existing domain search tools
  retain their schemas and native result shapes.
- `email_account_list`, `email_mailbox_list`, `email_identity_list`,
  `email_search`, `email_get`, `email_thread_get`, `email_changes`,
  `email_update`, `email_bulk_update`, `email_cleanup_preview`,
  `email_cleanup_apply`, `email_cleanup_receipt_list`, `email_draft_create`, `email_send`,
  `email_submission_get`, and `email_attachment_get` provide a native JMAP mail
  path. Compact searches keep Inbox triage bounded. Cleanup previews retain an
  exact candidate set for 30 minutes; applying one uses its Email state token to
  reject stale writes and moves the reviewed set to Trash or Archive in one
  recoverable operation. Reads go to the live mail store rather than a database
  cache. Draft creation never implies delivery; `email_send` is a separate
  externally effective operation and moves successful submissions from Drafts
  to Sent. Durable cleanup receipts reconstruct exact affected messages from
  successful tool calls even when the original final response was interrupted
  or incomplete.

## JMAP email

Agent Slayer discovers a standard JMAP Session resource at startup and only
registers email tools after authenticated discovery confirms both core and mail
capabilities. Set these values in `.env`:

```text
SLAYER_JMAP_SESSION_URL=https://api.fastmail.com/jmap/session
SLAYER_JMAP_ACCESS_TOKEN=<JMAP API token>
SLAYER_JMAP_REQUIRED=true
```

Fastmail API tokens are created under **Settings → Privacy & Security → Manage
API tokens**. Other conforming providers may use a different session URL. Set
`SLAYER_JMAP_ACCOUNT_ID` only when the session exposes multiple accounts and
the advertised primary mail account is not the intended one. The token remains
server-side and is excluded from health, traces, tool schemas, and tool results.

JMAP is the email authority: mailbox membership, keywords, threads, message
bodies, attachment blobs, identities, and submission state are read live.
`email_changes` exposes standard state-token pagination for efficient future
mirroring without making a local cache authoritative. Email does not use the MCP
configuration; the named local tool function performs each JMAP request and
returns its result to the same model exchange.

`config/profile-fact-questions.json` is the versioned catalog of standard
secretary question families. It defines a broad repeatable fact type, the exact
question, when it becomes relevant, and matching keyphrases. A deterministic
pre-model filter supplies at most three relevant types and all active rows of
those types. Each row has a stable ID and self-contained natural-language text
identifying its person or item. The model replaces an exact row by ID when that
same real-world fact changes, or adds another row for a different person or
item. No extra model call is made, and no profile section is sent when no
standard type is relevant. Answers live only in MariaDB; the repository contains
no user's profile values.

Remote MCP tools are discovered by Agent Slayer from
`config/mcp-servers.json` at process startup and rediscovered from every enabled,
authorized MCP when the web client's **Refresh** button is used. Added, removed,
and changed tool schemas replace that provider's prior registry entries. Their
exact discovered schemas are eligible for deterministic request selection
beside the local tools. Every
immediately callable schema is placed in the current model interaction; deferred
integration families appear first in the capability catalog and receive exact
schemas if the model requests them. The active model transport performs the
protocol translation. Provider-owned tools are not the application tool path.
Missing or failed integrations are visible in `/health`; they are never
silently represented as available.

An MCP can opt into application-managed persisted-file transfer by publishing
the versioned `agent-slayer/artifactUpload` metadata contract defined under
“Large artifacts across the Agent Slayer–MCP boundary” in
[`AGENT-TOOL-MANIFESTO.md`](AGENT-TOOL-MANIFESTO.md). Agent Slayer then exposes
one exact resumable file-upload function beside the provider's artifact consumer
tool. The application verifies local UTF-8 packaging, size, and SHA-256; sends
raw chunks of no more than 1 MiB through the provider's same-origin HTTP
artifact endpoint with the same bearer authorization; resumes from the
provider-confirmed byte offset; and verifies the completed provider artifact.
File contents never enter model context. Transfer does not infer or execute the
provider's domain workflow; the MCP consumer tool owns that later operation.
Required artifact routes or methods that contradict the advertised contract
are recorded as typed terminal failures. Agent Slayer does not let completion
repair retry that unchanged transfer, and it permits another attempt only after
a successful integration refresh rediscovers the provider tools.

MCP integrations with an `oauth` block use the standard MCP authorization-code
flow with OAuth discovery, dynamic client registration, PKCE, and refresh
tokens. Set `SLAYER_PUBLIC_URL` to the origin where a browser can reach Agent
Slayer, start the service, then use that integration's **Connect** button in the
web client's provider-neutral **Integrations** manager. Each configured OAuth
integration has its own status, action, and callback:

```text
<SLAYER_PUBLIC_URL>/api/integrations/<server-name>/oauth/callback
```

OAuth client registrations and tokens are stored as mode `0600` files under
`~/.local/state/agent-slayer/mcp-oauth` by default. The directory is mode
`0700`. Set `SLAYER_MCP_OAUTH_ROOT` to override it.

**Disconnect** immediately closes the MCP client, removes that provider's tools
from the callable registry, and deletes Agent Slayer's local OAuth registration
and tokens. This is intentionally described as a local disconnect: it does not
claim that the remote provider revoked its own grant when no revocation endpoint
is available.

TLOM currently uses its separately issued `TLOM_ACCESS_TOKEN` and is marked as
a required integration. Until that connection succeeds, health is not ready
and model requests are rejected with the integration status instead of falling
back to unrelated local database tools.

## Database and schema changes

No database is committed. MariaDB is the application's only database engine,
and `db/mariadb/0001-baseline.sql` is the authoritative schema for a fresh
installation. `npm run db:verify` checks the configured database's required
shape, schema version, ENUM values, required FULLTEXT indexes, and migration
integrity without
mutating data. Incremental changes are stacked newest-first in the single
`db/migrations.sql` ledger and applied oldest-first by `npm run db:migrate`.
`database_meta.schema_version` records the last completed migration, so an
already-applied block is skipped. See `db/MIGRATIONS.md` for the required
backup, downtime, verification, and recovery procedure.

Closed vocabularies are native MariaDB `ENUM` columns. `CHECK` constraints are
reserved for booleans, ranges, JSON validity, and rules involving more than one
value. Application database sessions require a strict SQL mode so invalid enum
input fails instead of being coerced to MariaDB's special empty enum value.

`profile_facts` is the authoritative store for durable user facts. Multiple
active rows may share a broad type such as `vehicle`; their text identifies the
person or item. Replacement and deletion target one stable row ID and archive
that row so prior versions remain observable without entering future model
context. Do not seed personal facts in a tracked migration: populate each
deployment through the profile-fact tools.

Storage comments are maintained directly in the baseline and migration ledger.
Changes to model-visible field meaning also belong in the owning tool's input
or output schema. No deployment-time extraction, fingerprint, or comment sync
is needed. The standalone schema compiler remains in its separate repository.

## Video

The Agent view can select one through eight completed interactions and start a
single video production. The normal Agent turn first creates a portable,
source-grounded script; `video_production_create` then atomically persists that
script and queues its linked `video_jobs` row. Script creation follows the
ordinary orientation, bounded-context, exact-tool-schema, and receipt rules.
The selection workflow opens as a temporary extension above the fixed request
composer rather than inside the chronological chat, keeping the newest
interactions visible while the user chooses sources.

The selected-interaction context contains each chosen user request and final
Agent response after a deterministic video-only projection removes machine
reference lines, legacy identity JSON, UUIDs, and unmistakably opaque long
identifiers. The stored request, response, and Agent context remain unchanged.
The creation tools ask the model only for the selected
request IDs, a concise title, and a one- or two-sentence description of the
conversation. The application then builds the portable script and external
generator prompt deterministically: a clear description that the video depicts
a user interacting with Chapeaux Fous, an AI agent, followed by the projected
chronological conversation. Neither artifact includes trace events, processing,
tool activity, a production brief, or an intermediate scene plan.

A single-concurrency background worker prepares the production after the Agent
turn finishes. The 1080x1620 MP4 is one continuous chat showing the
video-projected request and response for each selected interaction; trace,
processing, activity, machine references, intros, outros, and explanatory
narration are omitted. Request scenes use the original saved recording when one
exists and the transcript required no machine-reference filtering; otherwise,
the projected request is spoken in a feminine voice with a stronger natural French accent. Agent
responses use a masculine, standard-American voice. Both generated roles use a
fast, loose, mischievous conversational delivery rather than an announcer,
tutorial, corporate-demo, audiobook, or sales-presentation tone. The default
cast is Shimmer for typed user dialogue and Verse for Agent responses. Both
generated roles are prompted for an extremely fast delivery with minimal dead
air and are played at 1.3x speed in the MP4. Each generated track is passed
through local faster-whisper for word timestamps, allowing the active word in
the visible request or response to highlight in sync with the speech. New chat
bubbles spring upward from below and briefly overshoot into place while the
existing conversation scrolls naturally above them. TTS input
changes `Chapeaux Fous` to `Chapeaux Fou` only in the spoken copy and explicitly
directs a French `shah-POH FOO` pronunciation; visible dialogue remains
verbatim after the documented video-only projection.
Long generated speech is split into bounded provider calls and reassembled as
one WAV track. Dialogue is never silently ellipsized: a message over 20,000
characters or production over 60,000 fails with an explicit error before the
render begins.
Server-generated speech is explicitly disclosed as AI-generated in both the
Video Scripts page and the finished video. The Remotion composition is a
designed reproduction of the actual Agent chat bubbles—not a claim that the
product captured a screen recording.

Rendered bubbles use the live interface colors: user messages use `#6e7b61`,
Agent messages use `#4e5b43`, and both use white text. The active word uses a
white highlight instead of an unrelated accent color. Timed transcription words
are aligned to visible conversation tokens rather than assumed to have matching
token indexes. Long-message scrolling follows the spoken token against the
browser-measured text height so the active final line is not left partially
below the bubble viewport.

The **Video Scripts** page remains the durable home for the portable script and
external-generator prompt. It also shows the linked background state, polls
while work is active, downloads completed MP4s, and can retry failed renders.
Once an MP4 is complete, its title is a clickable stable reference that places
the video script, render job, and output-file IDs in the Agent composer. The
same card's **Add this video to content sequence** action lists active content
groups and appends the video with the next sequence number in the selected
group. The UI and Agent-callable `video_content_add` operation share the same
idempotent application workflow: the content item owns the rendered file and
exact script, while the video job records the resulting content item.
Rendering is deliberately outside the FIFO Agent request queue so a long MP4
does not block ordinary requests; interrupted `preparing` or `rendering` jobs
return to `queued` when the server starts.

Video production uses `SLAYER_VIDEO_OUTPUT_ROOT`, `SLAYER_TTS_MODEL`,
`SLAYER_TTS_AGENT_VOICE`, `SLAYER_TTS_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS`,
`SLAYER_TTS_USER_VOICE`, `SLAYER_TTS_USER_INSTRUCTIONS`, and
`SLAYER_TTS_TIMEOUT_MS`. The legacy `SLAYER_TTS_VOICE` and
`SLAYER_TTS_INSTRUCTIONS` names remain Agent-role fallbacks.
`REMOTION_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` may select an installed Chromium executable.
`OPENAI_API_KEY` is required when a queued production reaches narration.

## Voice transcription

The web client records audio and sends it to the same FIFO request queue. To
enable local transcription:

```bash
python3 -m venv voice/.venv
voice/.venv/bin/pip install -r voice/requirements.txt
```

The original recording is stored before transcription begins.

Responses to new typed and recorded requests are spoken by default through the
web browser's native speech synthesis. **Respond silently** suppresses speech
for that request and persists as a browser-local preference. This live-response
speech remains on the client device; the server-side speech service is reserved
for disclosed video narration. Written responses render GitHub-flavored Markdown after
HTML sanitization. Before speech playback, Markdown structure and formatting
punctuation are converted into natural pauses and spoken labels; code blocks are
left visible and summarized rather than read punctuation by punctuation.

## Deployment

`systemd/agent-slayer.service.example` is a reference only. Update its paths,
copy it into the user systemd directory, and enable it during the separate
deployment step.

After deploying an application update with no pending database migration,
restart the installed user service and inspect its status and recent startup
output:

```bash
systemctl --user restart agent-slayer.service
systemctl --user status agent-slayer.service --no-pager
journalctl --user -u agent-slayer.service -n 100 --no-pager
```

When an update includes a database migration, stop the running writer before
changing the database. If the dependency lock changed, install the exact
dependency set while the service is stopped. Apply the reviewed MariaDB
migration only after creating a current dump, then verify and start the service
again:

```bash
cd /home/nate/code/agent-chapeaux-fous

systemctl --user stop agent-slayer.service
npm ci

SLAYER_MIGRATION_BACKUP_CONFIRMED=1 \
SLAYER_MIGRATION_WRITERS_STOPPED=1 \
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:verify

systemctl --user start agent-slayer.service
systemctl --user status agent-slayer.service --no-pager
journalctl --user -u agent-slayer.service -n 100 --no-pager
```

Do not start the service if migration or verification fails. MariaDB DDL may
commit implicitly, so each migration must state its own safe replay and recovery
rules rather than assuming a transaction can roll back the complete schema
change. Database comment changes are applied by the migration runner along with the
deployed revision.

## Daily catch-up

Open **Check-in**, choose the catch-up settings at the top, and click **Start
catch-up**. You can also ask for the same selections in chat. This generates
questions directly from current tasks, calendar occurrences, and journal trackers. No briefing needs to be
created. The agent asks one question at a time and uses the existing domain tools
to complete or move tasks, update appointments, and record observations.
The button sends a normal agent request and preserves any draft text or attachment.
Existing briefings remain below Catch up in the same section.

Each category can be enabled independently:

- **Complete logs for:** today, yesterday, or a chosen past date, including today
  before it ends. Active trackers without asking schedules are included for that
  day; scheduled trackers use their daily, weekly, or monthly recurrence period
  containing the selected date. An observation in that period satisfies it.
- **Plan ahead through:** today, tomorrow, the next selected weekday (including
  today), or a chosen date, through the end of that local day. Only upcoming
  events with planning prompts qualify. Planning and post-event review have
  independent completion states for each occurrence.
- **Review past events through:** optional follow-up for ended events, with a
  cutoff and 0–31 days of lookback. This is disabled initially.

The browser remembers these controls. Relative choices such as yesterday,
Friday, and right now are resolved anew when Start is pressed. The owning
`catch_up_refresh` tool records the exact selection in its existing durable
refresh receipt; later answers and fresh chats reuse that scope until a new
selection is supplied. Logs for a missed day retain their selected period.
These settings add no table or schema migration.

`catch_up_questions` was introduced in migration 0036. Each row has exactly
one real foreign key to `calendar_events` or `trackers`, plus
its occurrence/period identity, generated question, resolution, deferral, and
optional comment. Unique source/occurrence indexes prevent duplicate questions.
Material-source fingerprints and question versions reject stale answers. Chat
history is not the source of pending or resolved state.

`catch_up_refresh` generates and reconciles questions during normal tool
execution; `catch_up_list` reads them, and `catch_up_question_update` records
explicit acknowledgment, deferral, or comments. The optional `catch-up.pending`
context view only reads already generated questions. It cannot generate or
mutate anything before execution. There is no timer or new background worker.

Scope filters apply before pagination. Questions outside the selected categories
or dates remain stored but are not asked in that check-in. Explicit deferrals
remain in force. Source scans are bounded; an overflow fails atomically rather
than claiming completeness. Planning is limited to one year ahead.

For compatibility, a refresh without any supplied or previously saved scope
uses recent calendar events and the latest due period of scheduled trackers.

Trackers remain unscheduled until `tracker_asking_schedule_set` sets a first
period start, structured recurrence, and time zone. A journal observation in the
period satisfies its question. Explicitly selecting a log date does not assign
permanent schedules to unscheduled trackers. Only the selected period is
generated, so a month away does not produce a month of missing daily logs.
Turning off the asking schedule preserves the tracker and its observations.

Completing/cancelling a source through the UI also satisfies its question on
refresh. Rescheduling changes when its question becomes eligible.
`calendar_event_occurrence_update` materializes an
exception and excludes the original occurrence so moving or cancelling one
appointment preserves the remaining series and participants. Comments and
resolution are optional, independent of the source's actual lifecycle status.

Apply migration 0036 through the existing reviewed migration procedure before
running this code against an older database. It adds one table and three nullable
tracker columns; existing trackers retain no asking schedule. Repository work
does not apply it to the live database or restart the application.
